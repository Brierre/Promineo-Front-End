        <h3>Greetings from the Organizers</h3>
        <p>Welcome to the KCSD Alumni Band home, where you can find all things related to upcoming gatherings, 
            enter and update your contact information, and one day view our photo galleries.</p>
        <h3>We're Happy You're Here!</h3>
        <p>The intent of this group is to involve the alumni from all of the bands in KCSD schools throughout 
            our district's history. Music is what brought us together in the first place, and it truly is a tie 
            that binds us. Our goal is to bring as many people back together as possible for the KCSD/LHU Homecoming 
            experience, so if you were a part of the marching band at any KCSD school--ever, you are invited to join 
            us. Whether your school still exists or not, whether you played an instrument or twirled/spun, and no 
            matter how long ago it was, we are looking for you!</p>
        <p>Making contact with all the people is the most difficult part of organizing a group like this one, and 
            we will need your help. We have created a contact form (click the link below) for you to enter your 
            information. Please feel free to share it far and wide! Also share our facebook posts so we can reach 
            as many alumni as possible.</p>
        <p>Please submit accurate contact information so we are able to get in touch with you.</p>

        <h3>History of the Homecoming Event</h3>
        <p>KCSD teamed up with LHU in 2019 for the first joint Homecoming Parade.  The CMHS marching band joined 
            together with the LHU marching band to march in the parade. At the old LHHS gymnasium (now LHU's East 
            Campus), the Central Mountain and Bucktail students in attendance met to hold a pep rally, celebrating 
            both schools, while the LHU groups continued up Main Street to the university, where they held their own 
            festivities.  It was a community event that was well-received by the public, and a positive and fun 
            experience for all.

        <h3>The Overarching Goal</h3>
        <p>	
            Our eventual goal is to have an alumni event every five years, which will include the option to 
            participate in the parade and pep rally, as well as the opportunity to sit in the stands once again, 
            cheering on the high school marching band as they perform their field show, and playing pep tunes 
            and fight songs for the subsequent CMHS varsity football game.  All performances depend on the schedules 
            created by the university and the school district/athletic department, so dates are to be determined, 
            but this is our goal.
